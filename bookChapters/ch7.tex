\begin{itemize}
\item Kinetic energy associated with the motion of a particle of mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ 

\item Work is defined as the energy transferred to or from an object via a force acting on that object. Energy transferred to the object is positive work, and from the object, negative work. 
\item Work done on a particle by a constant force $\vec{F}$ during displacement $\vec{d}$ is $w=Fd\cos \theta = \vec{F}\dot \vec{d}$ 
\item work done by the gravitational force on a particle-like object of mass $m$ is given as $W_g=mgd\cos \theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{F_g}$ and $\vec{d}$. 
\item The force $\vec{F_s}$ from a spring is $\vec{f_s}=-k\vec{d}$ (Hooke's Law)
\item Work done by a spring is given as $W_s=\frac{1}{2}(kx_{i}^2-kx_f^2)$
